## Description
The Employee Tracker is a command-line application that is able to display and update an organization's information database. The command-line prompts the user to choose what they would like to do, such as View Departments and Employees or Update Roles, and shows or updates the database accordingly. The application uses the responses from the command line to populate and update the existing employee database. Any additions the user implements in the command are automatically updated in the data displayed after entering the new information.

## Usage
